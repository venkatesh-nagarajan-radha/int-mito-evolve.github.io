**Current Research Projects:**

- **Senescence in *Neurospora intermedia***  
  Investigating how extragenomic mitochondrial plasmids integrate into mtDNA and contribute to ageing.

- **Disease Ecology of Paramyxovirus in Fruit Bats**  
  Understanding zoonotic spillover risks and immune responses.

- **Mitochondrial Genomic Variation in Drosophila**  
  Exploring mitonuclear interactions and environmental context on traits.

Each project integrates ecological theory with molecular approaches, often supported by international collaborations.
